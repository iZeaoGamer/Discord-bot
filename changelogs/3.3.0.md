- Added Support for Storing Messages

This release adds full support for storing Messages!

This could be useful for things like purging messages, and getting a message objective by either id, channel, or by server. With this, you can also Get all messages in total on the total current discord servers it's joined. It can even also be used for getting all messages, sent by the user.

Deprecated MessageBulkDeleteEvent, which will later be removed, and replaced with handleMessageDelete event (Essentially all messages deleted will count as per handleMessageDelete() event, which will therefore be used for easier management.

- Check if Channel type is text before getting all messages from a specific channel.

- Added @deprecated note for handleMessageBulkDelete event.

- Added back Main->get().

- Fixed ServerScheduledEvent return typehint from returning the wrong model.

- Added the following API Methods:

* Storage->addMessage()

* Storage->updateMessage()

* Storage->removeMessage()

* Storage->bulkRemove()

* Storage->getMessagesByUser()

* Storage->getMessages()

- Main: Fixed typo

- Storage: Fixed typo

- Storage: Fixed instance message checking

This commit implements support for CHANNEL_MESSAGES endpoint, which allows more support for controls of messages.

Activate MessageDeletedEvent when deleting messages.

**KEEP IN MIND**
We may however, change this behavior if this new system doesn't work, which we hope it will work.
