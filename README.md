# Discord-bot-Test
A discord-feature rich API plugin for PMMP.


## Note
I do not own this plugin. This plugin is made just for bug fixes that couldn't of been done in the other Discord-Bot API, and implementing more discord features, such as Threads, (sorta) working emoji buttons support, and more!
Alongside this, my plan is to make this API as customizeable as possible.

Curently, we have not fully implemented Emoji buttons to the API just yet.
We hope to implement this very soon!

## PRODUCTION NOICE

Because this plugin is feature rich, and isn't fully-completed in terms with new features, we ask for you to not download the dev build releases. An official release will be announced on the github releases tab once it's stabled again.

If you really want to download these dev builds, then you can. I do not hold responsibility for me or this plugin if it breaks or stops working. You have been warned.
