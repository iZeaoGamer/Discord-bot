# Discord-bot Feature-Rich
A discord-feature rich API plugin for PMMP.


## Note
I do not own this plugin. This plugin is made just for bug fixes that couldn't of been done in the other Discord-Bot API, and implementing more discord features, such as Threads, (sorta) working emoji buttons support, and more!
Alongside this, my plan is to make this API as customizeable as possible.

Curently, we have not fully implemented Emoji buttons to the API just yet.
We hope to implement this very soon!
